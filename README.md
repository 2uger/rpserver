### Riders Platform
* It's all about opportunity for riders to create something bigger
* We provide simple interface with City map to find and checkout spots
* Ability to find another riders by their coordinates(if they want to, of course...)

Our main idea is to provide easy to acces platform for riders to be in a contact with each other
