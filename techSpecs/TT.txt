"""RidersPlatform's technical task"""


OVERALL DESCRIPTION
	1 Purpose
	The idea is to make rider's contacts more comfortable with each other. Whole map will give all needed information 
	to rider even from other country, he could see all spots in town, and also see all events in this town
	(which he should find somewhere else, if there is no app). 
	Rider will have opportunity to make friends and follow them on map, also he would create events on map to ride together. 
	It's all to make rider's life easier and comfortable.
